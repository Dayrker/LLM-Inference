Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\nD) The concept of energy security is a construct of the capitalist system and should be rejected in favor of a more equitable distribution of resources.\nE) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\nF) Energy security is best ensured through the privatization of energy resources, allowing for a free-market competition to drive innovation and efficiency.\nG) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.\nH) Energy security is not a major concern, as technological advancements will continue to provide new ways to generate energy.",

    "input": "A) There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur.\nB) Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain.\nC) Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts.\nD) Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives. Domestic pressures may result in a regime gravitating towards nuclear war fighting strategies to win a rapid victory and strengthen status.",

The heavier element produced from a fissions reaction, and the difference in mass from the two lighter nuclei (which is translated into an energy explosion) can be precision calculated. Bombs even within the multi-megaton range have unlimited military utility, their destructive capability can be manufactured according to the target.\nE) A fusion weapon is a three-stage-bomb that uses an implosion device to create a fission reaction, which then detonates a fusion reaction. It is often referred to as a thermo-nuclear or hydrogen device and has unlimited destructive potential.\nF) Fusion devices are single-stage bombs that use a fission reaction to trigger a fusion reaction, leading to a high energy explosion with limited thermal energy.\nG) A fusion device is a two-stage process where a gun-type device is used to trigger a series of fission reactions with the cumulative result being the production of a high energy flash explosion with unlimited thermal energy.\nH) Fusion devices use the principle of splitting heavy elements to generate energy, while fission devices combine light elements to release energy.\nI) A fusion reaction is created when the nuclei of two light elements are combined, the reaction resulting in heavier elements fragmenting into smaller parts. This fragmentation releases energy of limited destructive capacity, the extent of energy released dependent on the mass of material used.\nJ) A fusion weapon is a four-stage-bomb that uses a gun-type device to create a fission reaction, which then triggers a fusion reaction. The weapon has a specific destructive effect.",

If the wealth is not as great as is widely believed, their threat to the licit economy is vastly reduced.\nC) Hierarchical forms of organization are highly adaptable and small fluid groups enable a pronounced degree of resilience (attributable to the logic of supply rising to meet demand) against law enforcement efforts confined to rigid ranking of cooperation.\nD) Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership. Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy.",

Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.\nF) Strong states do not face the risk of conflict due to environmental changes, as they have the ability to mitigate the effects of these changes.\nG) The environmental security agenda for strong states is not concerned with conflict, as these states have sufficient resources to manage environmental changes.\nH) Common findings in research organizations investigating environmental violence have failed to find quantifiable relationships between environmental and social variables and the cause of war. Analysis of aggregated data failed to establish a common causal mechanism. The extensity of possible variables being simply too vast, mitigating any definitive relationship.\nI) Population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation can lead to environmentally caused conflict. There is therefore a linear link between population growth and environmental change, and environmental change is the critical determinant in the production of violence.",

Sub-state organizations are a practical solution to dealing with regions with endemic problems of weapons and poverty, whilst regional organization is a sustainable structural form in Africa and Latin America.\nB) The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project. The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms.\nC) The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state.\nD) Weak states can become strong by adopting autocratic forms of governance and suppressing internal dissent.\nE) The security dilemma of weak states can be solved by pooling their resources and forming regional security alliances.\nF) Weak states have embarked on a protracted and difficult process to attain effective status. Long term security strategies have resulted in the adoption of measures to counteract the worst of the effects including the establishment of multi parties, economic liberalization and membership of the international community.\nG) The weak state security dilemma is a myth, propagated by strong states to maintain global hegemony.\nH) The international community has largely ignored the security dilemma of weak states, focusing instead on expanding global trade networks.\nI) Weak states are not inherently insecure; it's their handling and response to security threats that determine their stability.\nJ) The rise of non-state actors like transnational corporations and international non-governmental organizations has effectively made the concept of state security obsolete.",

The regime is often legitimized through the use of force.\nB) Weak states have a well-developed bureaucracy and are able to enforce their policies through a cohesive social-political structure. They often rely on the legitimacy of the regime to maintain control.\nC) Weak states possess high levels of social-political cohesion which is correlated to the hegemonic enforcement idea of the regime, which in turn becomes accepted to the point of being legitimized as the social norm.\nD) Weak states have strong military capabilities and maintain absolute loyalty from the armed forces. They frequently intervene in social matters to maintain control.\nE) Weak states do not utilize coercive capabilities in normal policy. State institutions typically have a developed bureaucracy which legitimizes the regime's ability to rule. Paradoxically, however, the more a weak state exercises its coercive power the more it reinforces its infrastructural power but reduces its ability to rule.\nF) Weak states have a monopoly on the instruments of violence and have the coercive capability to force compliance even when social actors attempt to resist. The regimes lack popular legitimacy, the integrity of the regime's survival is consolidated by power resulting in the naturalization of violence within society.\nG) Weak states have a monopoly over social actors and are able to maintain control through the use of force. They also have well-equipped and well-managed armed forces.\nH) The most important characteristics of weak states are their frequent inability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence. Even within states with well developed coercive power they do not always retain absolute loyalty and are faced with a real possibility of military intervention. Whilst armed forces are ill-equipped, poorly managed and prone to factional divisions, social actors are powerful enough to resist governance. Therefore, monopoly over the instruments of violence is infrequent.",

Assistance derived from superpowers was superseded by US hegemonic endorsement at the end of the Cold War.\nB) The end of the Cold War had no significant impact on warlord politics, as these patterns of governance were already well-established in many regions.\nC) The end of the Cold War led to a transition from warlord politics to more centralized forms of governance, as international actors sought to promote state-building and development.\nD) Within the context of state collapse, elites deliberately engender disorder for the pursuit of commercial activities and the exploitation of neo-liberal globalized shadow markets which would not otherwise be permissible in normal conditions. Warlord politics represented a new form of regime security forced upon weak state elites.\nE) Warlord politics in response to the rapid global changes inaugurated by the end of the Cold War and by globalization, was a temporary aberration in the normal function of the state and was reflective of the immediate need to secure infrastructural survival.\nF) Warlord politics remained largely unchanged following the end of the Cold War, as these power structures were rooted in local dynamics rather than international politics.\nG) The end of the Cold War led to a dramatic rise in warlord politics, as the power vacuum left by the superpowers created an opportunity for local strongmen to seize control.\nH) Warlord politics were undermined by the end of the Cold War, as the reduction in superpower competition decreased the resources available to these actors.\nI) Warlord politics saw a decline with the end of the Cold War, as international interventions aimed at democratization increased.",

Initially, the field was conditioned by the nuclear arms race and East-West divide that characterised the Cold War, but was quick to embrace environmental concerns and the issues surrounding the North-South wealth/poverty divide.\nB) Peace studies developed during the 1960s and 1970s as a reaction to the civil rights movement and anti-war protests, focusing on social justice issues and the role of nonviolent resistance in promoting peace.\nC) Developed as a response to World War I, peace studies focuses on disparities in wealth and resource allocation that exist within the global system, with the aim of promoting peace through the equal distribution of these resources.\nD) The field of peace studies emerged during the Cold War, primarily focusing on the East-West divide and the potential for nuclear war, with a secondary focus on the impact of war on the environment.\nE) Peace studies emerged as a field of research in the post-Cold War era, largely driven by the need to understand and address the root causes of internal conflicts and civil wars.\nF) Developed during the era of decolonization, peace studies focuses on the legacy of colonialism and its impact on conflicts and tensions in the global South.\nG) Peace studies developed as a discipline following the Cold War when the security studies paradigm shifted to include areas of concern such as environmental, societal and economic security. As a field of research peace studies adopts a Euro-centric approach to security and has thus been defined by developments within the West and wealthier nations.\nH) Peace studies emerged as a response to the developing nuclear capability of states during the Cold War. The aim of peace studies is to secure the state as a referent object and does this through the study of weapons accumulation. The approach is particularly focused on the nuclear arms race between East and West.\nI) Peace studies emerged in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, primarily focusing on the issues surrounding war atrocities and the impact of war on civilian populations.",

The consequence is that theory is the product of the system, and that analyses of the agent of security and the referent object is produced by its own practices.\nB) Central to the political and critical nature of post-structural literature is the idea of fostering an ethos of democracy and an ethos of critique which is finite and attainable. It is to this end that we must strive, but one that can only be met under the conditions prescribed, that of true democracy.\nC) Poststructuralism accepts the form and foundations for knowledge claims that dominate the security studies debate.

    "input": "A) Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the \"stick\" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.\nB) Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.\nC) In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.\nD) Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.",

    "input": "A) The viability of the CWC and BCW providing a concrete basis in international law to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is dubious. The Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent the illicit trade in materials relating to chemical and nuclear weapons is an equally piecemeal pursuit. Whilst they may serve some utility as a framework for diplomatic exchanges, they are essentially toothless bodies lacking the political will to establish an authority with the powers to police the control and use of these weapons.\nB) The International Non-proliferation Regime has been rendered effectively defunct in the post-Cold War climate. State actors seeking to develop their own weapons capabilities have de-stabilized norms governing the use and control of WMD. This has been evidenced by severe splits in the body following the 1998 Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing and the withdrawal of great power support following the US Senate's decision not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\nC) Contemporary concern has been pacified by the fact that WMD threat has greatly diminished with the end of the Cold War. A number of deployed Soviet (Russian) and strategic warheads and US tactical nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from service thereby removing the threat of total war by massive nuclear exchange.\nD) WMD terrorism poses a security threat that is not easily met by today's policy community or military establishments. The second strike rule is virtually obsolete because of the difficulty of locating such groups and deterrence is an unviable strategy given that objective of attacks are frequently politically, ideologically or religiously motivated.",

An act of terrorism targets an audience that extends beyond the immediate victims and is characterized as being a weapon of the weak.\nC) Terrorist violence is a form of psychological warfare that generates fear in a target audience by attacking members of that group. Selected targets are chosen at random from a cross-section of groups within the state ranging from political representatives, security forces, civilians or law enforcement. Random acts of violence contribute to the sense of insecurity and societal instability.\nD) Terrorism is a broad concept that is understood to denote the threat or use of organized violence for the attainment of political objectives.

Following this period security studies have been broadened to include the wider range of sectors that we see today, including environmental and political security.\nE) Military security has emerged since the Cold War as the dominant sector within security analysis; both scholars and practitioners recognise the paramount importance of pursuing military security, based on the idea that military capabilities pose the greatest threat to human and state survival.\nF) Post-Cold War, security studies have shifted their focus entirely to environmental and economic security, neglecting military security.\nG) Military security has remained the sole focus of security studies throughout the 20th century, with no consideration given to other sectors such as environmental or economic security.\nH) Security studies has always favoured a wide range of subjects when considering the field of security. Different types of security, most notably of human security and economic security, have enjoyed a great deal of attention in traditional security studies, alongside military security. After the Cold War this approach was broadened to include other types of security such as environmental and personal security.",

Sanctions against countries that provide a territorial base for terrorism may be misplaced, having negligible effects on the terrorist organizations themselves.\nB) Countries often resist international measures out of concerns over sovereignty. This can limit the effectiveness of these measures and hinder international cooperation against terrorism.\nC) A great deal of international diplomacy has involved attempts to define terrorism so that all countries could take steps to eradicate it. However, these efforts have largely faltered: countries often support or sympathize with dissidents who use violence against repressive governments; governments in developing countries have wanted to avoid anti-colonial struggles being labelled as terrorism; and countries want to retain a degree of flexibility regarding extradition and punishment of political dissidents.\nD) Intelligence agencies are highly centralized, organized structures that operate at a maximum functional level within their domestic context. There is no reason to presume that collaboration would enhance their ability to contribute to the prevention of terrorism.

The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.\nB) The weak state insecurity dilemma is primarily an external condition creating a situation for the weak state similar to structural anarchy, wherein a weak state creates insecurity in the region when taking measures to improve its own regional standing.\nC) The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.\nD) Weak state insecurity dilemmas are born out of a lack of political and institutional centring with a monopoly of force.

A particular emphasis has been placed on environmental change as the cause of violent conflict and addressing environmental threats from other factors than domestic causes.\nC) The national security perspective on environmental issues has undermined the utility of the concept of environmental security. The militarization of environmental problems has decreased the ability of policymakers to 'capture' the critical nature of environmental problems and the environmental dimensions to social vulnerability. The reconciliation of environmental security with national security, and global levels of international change cannot be made without trading in the security interests of the state.\nD) The securitization of environmental security concerns has raised the profile of environmental security issues among both foreign and domestic security policymakers and agencies. It is now uniformly recognized that environmental change can be considered as an issue of high security politics.\nE) The 'securitization' of the environment has led to a significant increase in funding and resources allocated to environmental protection and conservation efforts.\nF) The environment has been 'securitized' in the sense that environmental security has been used to make them matters of 'high politics'. This has to some degree raised the profile of critical issues among policymakers and agencies so that the environment can be considered an issue of security.

Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis.\nC) Societal security referred to the sustainable development of traditional patterns of military capabilities. Military threats could be subdivided to include the infrastructural strength, the technology, personnel, the economic base and the political base of the military security sector.\nD) Contemporary processes of globalization and societal conflict required the development of new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object.

Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon.\nB) Construction of the means to transmit biological weapons in warfare has focused on the use of vectors, for example lice, fleas, or mosquitoes, as a mode of transmission as a military weapon. These are favoured because the target would find it difficult to contain the source of the outbreak, placing the infrastructure of the target country under strain.\nC) Biological agents comprise bacteria, viral, and toxin agents. However, not every disease provides the basis for an effective biological weapon. An agent's storage, delivery, mode of transmission and its very resilience can shape its effects on a target population.\nD) Inoculation programs against naturally occurring disease have eradicated the potential for viral agents to cause a global pandemic. Vaccination capabilities have undermined calls for the weaponization of viral agents made by some military strategists as most public health authorities have in place programs to deal with a possible outbreak.",

The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.\nC) The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.\nD) The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security.

Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.\nB) The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.\nC) The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.\nD) Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood. Without protection under international laws the possibility of its national status being revoked and its territory being subsumed into another state threatens the consolidation of the state-building process.",

Military security was a high priority given the threat of spill-over. The environment remained a peripheral concern to the security institutions occupied with the new security environment post-Cold War.\nD) The end of the Cold War order created the intellectual space for the broadening of security issues beyond Cold War military mentalities.

The concept of gender security broadens terms of security beyond the military sector to also include 'human security'.\nE) Gender security refers to the protection of individual genders from discrimination and violence, and the term gender refers to the societal roles, behaviors, and activities that a society considers appropriate for men and women.\nF) Gender security refers to the safety and protection of individuals based on their gender identity, while gender refers to an individual's self-identification as man, woman, or non-binary.\nG) Gender security is essentially an extension of the way in which we conceptualize the international political system. The analysis of gender security relations has only been made possible by the expansion of the traditional military definition of security in which national security in anarchical international society was the exclusive province of the male.\nH) Gender security is the analysis of gender roles in the context of national and international security, while gender refers to the biological distinction between males and females.\nI) To study gender security is to focus on the role of adult women in modern warfare, including industries related to warfare, and their inclusion or exclusion from combat roles.\nJ) Gender refers to the roles and behaviors that society deems appropriate for men and women, while gender security is the study of how these roles influence and are influenced by security issues.",

The 'right to fight' debate has equal meaning and saliency across the globe, and is universally applicable in all situations.\nD) Nuclear armaments and the threat of mass destruction have rendered the battlefield gender neutral in terms of its destructive capabilities.
